# Tonari backend

Tonari (from the Japanese éš£ which means "next door" / "the closest to you") is a webapp and API that enables searching for wheelchair-accessible sanitary facilities and enhancing the related datasets.

Check the live version out: https://tonari.app

This is the backend of Tonari.
Its purpose is to serve as a database for changes to facilities made in Tonari.

## Compiling

To compile this you will need a nightly Rust compiler, which you can find [here](https://rustup.rs/). The last tested version of the compiler is `rustc 1.33.0-nightly (a7be40c65 2018-12-26)`.

Then to compile the backend for debugging, run:

```bash
cargo build --features testpages
```

If you want to compile a release build, run:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

Alternatively you check out the `Makefile` to see what else you can do.
For example to open the documentation, you can run `make doc_open`, if you have `make` installed.

## Running

To start the backend, run the executable located at `target/release/backend` (replace `release` with `debug` for debug builds).

To run it in a staging or production enviroment, set the environment variable `ROCKET_ENV` to `staging` or `production`.

```bash
ROCKET_ENV=production target/release/backend
```

## Configuration

To find out what configuration options are available, take a look at the configuration module (`src/configuration.rs`).

You can set the default values in that file or override the default values using environment variables of the same name prefixed with "`TONARI_`".

For example you could set the path where the images are stored in the following way:

```bash
TONARI_IMAGE_PATH=/my/image/path target/release/backend
```

### Configuring the Web Server

The server can be configured via a file named `Rocket.toml` (in the working directory of the server) or via environment variables.
For more information on the configuration, check out the [documentation](https://rocket.rs/guide/configuration/).

#### Setting the Port

The setting you will most likely want to change from the default configuration is the port. You can set the port in the `Rocket.toml`
file or use an environment variable directly. To run the server on port 12345 run

```bash
ROCKET_PORT=12345 target/release/backend
```

#### Setting the Database Connection

To inform the server where to find the database you need to have the following in your `Rocket.toml` (or set it as an environment variable).

```toml
[global.databases]
sanitary_facilities = { url = "mongodb://localhost:27017/sanitary_facilities" }
```

### Required Configuration

Before you can run this in production you need to do at least the following things:

- Generate the vapid certificates (see [Getting ready to run](#getting-ready-to-run)).
- Set the database connection (see [Setting the database connection](#setting-the-database-connection)).
- Set the environment variable `TONARI_SOURCE_ID` to the `sourceId` of Tonari in the accessibility.cloud.
- Set the environment variable `TONARI_IMAGE_URL_PREFIX` to the prefix of the URL where images are served.
  (see the section on [image urls](#image-urls)).
- Set the environment variable `TONARI_IMAGE_PATH` to the file path where the images are to be saved. Note
  that if you change this, images uploaded so far won't change their path, i.e. keep their old path.

### Image URLs

In order to allow images to be flexible and also work with images on remote servers, the URLs for
images are generated at the time of their insertion into the database. However, this means that changing
the `TONARI_IMAGE_URL_PREFIX` variable will not update any existing image paths. That needs to be done manually
if necessary.

#### Serving Images Using a Different Server

Note that you may want to serve the images using a different server. If your server serves the images
at the URL `https://your.domain/my-images/` you can set the backend up so that any new image URLs are created
to point to that location. An example invocation of the server could look like this:

```bash
TONARI_IMAGE_URL_PREFIX=https://your.domain/my-images/ TONARI_IMAGE_URL_SUFFIX=.jpg target/release/backend
```

Note that the `TONARI_IMAGE_URL_SUFFIX` variable is set to the extension of the images. This allows URLs
like `https://your.domain/my-images/8efbfe48-9a8a-41a8-8b2d-307b8cfffff4.jpg` to be routed to your server.

## API Documentation

You can find the API documentation [here](API.md).

## Testing the API

Compile the backend with the `testpages` feature to have easy access to rudimentary testpages at `/testpages/`.

After you have installed MongoDB, you can use the `mongo` utility to view how the requests manipulate the data.

```bash
$ mongo
> use sanitary_facilities
> db.facilities.find().pretty()
```

Replace `sanitary_facilities` and `facilities` with the name you chose for the database and collection
respectively, if you changed them through environment variables.
